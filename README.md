# CodeRetreat Python Starter Project

---

This project provides an empty starter project for python

## Preparing for development

- Create a virtualenv using python >= 3.10 and `pip install -r requirements.txt` (Pycharm will probably suggest to do that automatically when you open the project)
- Run the `tests/test_main.py` module and verify the test is passing
